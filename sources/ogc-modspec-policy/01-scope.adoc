== Scope
This OGC Policy Document defines the OGC Policy and Guidance related to the use of the ModSpec.

The ModSpec defines characteristics and structure for the specification of Standards 
that will encourage implementation by minimizing difficulty determining
requirements, mimicking implementation structure and maximizing usability and
interoperability. 

Part 1 of the ModSpec defines the requirements for using UML. 
The use case is if the organizing mechanism for the data model 
used in a standard is an object model, then the mapping from parts of the model to 
the requirements classes should follow the logical mechanism described in Part 1 of the ModSpec.

Part 2 of the ModSpec defines the requirements for using XML. The XML related requirements classes 
cover any standard which has as one of its purposes the introduction of a new XML schema. 
Such a standard would normally define the schema, all of its components, and its intended uses.
