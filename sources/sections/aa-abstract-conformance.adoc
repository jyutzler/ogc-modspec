dependency.

==== Imported Conformance class tests are consistent with the specification

If a requirements class is imported from another standard for use within a
standard conformant to this standard, and if any imported requirement is
"optional," then that requirement _SHALL_ be factored out as a separate requirements
class in the profile of that imported standard used in the conformant standard.
Each such used requirements class _SHALL_ be a conformance class of the source
standard or a combination of conformance classes of the source standard or standards.

classes and conformance test classes having similar names.

. Reference: <<req-14>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== Requirements in one and only one requirements class

Each requirement in the standard _SHALL_ be contained in one and only one requirements
class. Inclusion of any requirement in a requirements class by a conformance class
_SHALL_ imply inclusion of all requirements in its class (as a dependency).

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-15>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== Co-dependent Requirements are in the same requirements class

If any two requirements or two requirements modules are co-dependent (each dependent
on the other) then they _SHALL_ be in the same requirements class or module. If any two
requirements classes are co-dependent, they _SHALL_ be merged into a single class.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
