can be tested by inspection. The test suite is in <<annex-A>>.

There is conformance class for this document:

. Standards documents in general (the core) -- see <<cls-6>> and <<annex-A-1>>

This document contains normative language and thus places requirements on
conformance, or mechanism for adoption, of candidate standards to which the ModSpec
applies. In particular:

* <<cls-6>> specifies the core requirements which shall be met by all conformant
standards.
* <<cls-7>> gives information on how the ModSpec is to be applied to extensions to the core model for requirements,
conformance clauses.
