[[cls-2]]
== Conformance

Conformance to the ModSpec by technical implementation standards 
can be tested by inspection. The test suite is in <<annex-A>>.

There is one conformance class for this document:

. The Core: Common requirements for standards documents in general. See <<cls-6>> and <<annex-A-1>>

This document contains normative language and thus places requirements on
conformance, or mechanism for adoption, of candidate standards to which the ModSpec
applies. In particular:

* <<cls-6>> specifies the core requirements which shall be met by all conformant
standards.
* <<cls-7>> gives information on how the ModSpec is to be applied to extensions to the core model for requirements and
conformance clauses.

Such extensions are defined in additional Parts (volumes) to the Core.
