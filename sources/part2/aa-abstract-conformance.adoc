=== Conformance test class: XML schema

==== Dependency on Core

An implementation passing the XML schema conformance test class shall first pass the ModSpec
Core Standard conformance test class.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-39>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== Dependency on W3C XML schema

An implementation passing the XML schema conformance test class shall first pass the
W3C Recommendation for XML schema.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-40>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== A requirements class corresponds to a single XML namespace

If a standard conformant to the XML schema conformance class defines a set of
data schemas, all components (e.g. elements, attributes, types ...) associated with
a single conformance test class shall be scoped to a single XML namespace.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-41>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== A reference to the URI of the test suite in AppInfo

The all-components schema document for an XML Schema shall indicate the URI of the
associated conformance test class in the schema/annotation/appinfo element.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-42>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== Direct dependencies become schema imports

If a standard conformant to the XML schema conformance class defines a direct
dependency from one requirement class to another, then a standardization target of
the corresponding conformance test class shall import a schema that has passed the
associated conformance test class (dependency) or shall itself pass the associated
conformance test class.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-43>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== No requirements class modifies or redefines elements in another namespace

No requirements class in a standard conformant to the XML schema conformance
class shall modify elements, types or any other requirement from a namespace to
which it is not associated.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-44>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== Conformance test class: Schematron

==== Dependency on XML Schema conformance test class

A standard passing the Schematron conformance test class shall also define or
reference an XML schema that shall pass the XML schema conformance class from this
standard.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-45>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== Each schematron pattern element implements one requirement

Each sch:pattern element shall implement constraints described in no more than one
requirement. Each requirement shall be implemented by no more than one sch:pattern.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-46>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== Each schematron pattern is in one schematron element

Each sch:pattern element shall be contained within one sch:schema element.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-47>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== Each schematron @fpi attribute is used only once

The value of the sch:schema/@fpi attribute shall be used on only one Schematron
schema.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-48>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== Each schematron @see attribute is used only once

The value of the sch:schema/@see attribute shall be the identifier for the
requirements class that contains the requirement(s) implemented by the schema

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-49>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== Each schematron fpi attribute is used only once

The value of the sch:schema/@fpi attribute shall be used on only one Schematron
schema.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-50>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== Conformance Class: XML meta-schema

==== Supports the Specification class

A standard passing the XML meta-schema conformance test class shall first pass
the ModSpec Core conformance test class.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-51>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

==== Each XML schema is conformant with the XML Schema class

A standard passing the XML meta-schema conformance test class shall require
that its standaridization targets (XML schema) pass the XML schema conformance class
from this standard.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-52>>
. Test Type: Conformance.
