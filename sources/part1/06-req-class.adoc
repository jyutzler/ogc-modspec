== Requirements Class: Part 1 UML

This clause defines the key concepts and requirements that represent Part 1 of the ModSpec.

=== The ModSpec and the "Form" of a standard

NOTE: For OGC Standards, the assumption is that documents are in a commonly used
logical form (template). 

In informative sections, the use of the word "will" implies that something is an implication of a requirement. The "will" statements are not requirements but explain the consequence of requirements.

The ModSpec defines a "requirement" of a standard as an atomic testable
criterion. See the formal definition of requirement in <<term-requirement>>
